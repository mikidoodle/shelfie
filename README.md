An app for the Cider YSWS. Shelfie is a book management app that helps you keep track of what youâ€™ve read and what you want to read. You can log books into your personal library, receive book recommendations, and share your reviews on the explore page for everyone to see.

there was a brief git conflict crisis during it development so a couple of hours had git commits under the repo [mikidoodle/shelfie-new](https://github.com/mikidoodle/shelfie-new). I resolved it and this repo is up-to-date. I'll delete the other one after my hours are reviewed.
